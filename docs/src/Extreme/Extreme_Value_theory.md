# [Extreme Value Copulas](@id Extreme_theory)

*Extreme value copulas* are fundamental in the study of rare and extreme events due to their ability to model dependency in situations of extreme risk. An extreme value copula $C$ has the property that $C(u_1^t, u_2^t)=(C(u_1,u_2))^t, t > 0,$ and can be represented by
```math
C(u_1, u_2)=\exp\{-\ell(\log(u_1),\log(u_2))\}
```
or
```math
C(u_1,u_2)=\exp\left\{\log(u_1u_2)A\left(\frac{\log(u_1)}{\log(u_1u_2)}\right)\right\}
```
Here, $\ell(\cdot)$ is the stable tail dependence function and $A$ is the Pickands dependence function where $$A: \[0,1\] \to \[1/2, 1\]$$ is a convex function satisfying $\max(t, t-1)\leq A(t) \leq 1.$ In the context of bivariate extreme value copulas, the functions $\ell$ and $A$ are related as follows:
```math
\ell(u_1,u_2)=(u_1+u_2)A\left(\frac{u_1}{u_1+u_2}\right).
```
Therefore, in *TwinCopulas*, it is sufficient to provide the Pickands dependence function $A$ to construct the implementation structure of an extreme value copula.

In this package, there is an abstract type [`ExtremeValueCopula`] that provides a foundation for defining extreme value copulas. Many extreme value copulas are already implemented for you! See [the list of implemented extreme value copulas] to get an overview.

If you do not find the one you need, you may define it yourself by subtyping `ExtremeValueCopula`. The API does not require much information, which is really convenient. Only the following method is required:

* ùòà(C::ExtremeValueCopula) =

By providing this functions, you can easily create a new extreme value copula that fits your specific needs.

```julia
struct MyExtremeValueCopula{P} <: ExtremeValueCopula{P}
    Œ∏::P
end

ùòà(C::ExtremeValueCopula, t) = (t^C.Œ∏ + (1 - t)^C.Œ∏)^(1/C.Œ∏) # This is the Pickands function of the Logistic (Gumbel) Copula
```

!!! info "Nomenclature information"
    We have called `ùòà()` the Pickands function, which is necessary for constructing the Extreme Value Copula. The letter we use is `\isansA`.

# Advanced Concepts

Here, we present some important concepts from the theory of extreme value copulas that are useful for the development of this package.

Let $(X,Y) \sim C$ where $C$ is a bivariate extreme value copula. We have the following results:

> **Proposition 1 ([`Ghoudi1998`]):** Let $(X, Y) \sim C$, where $C$ is an extreme value copula. The joint distribution of $X$ and $Z = \frac{\log(X)}{\log(XY)}$ is given by:
>
> $$P(Z \leq z, X \leq x) =G(z,x)=\left(z + z(1-z)\frac{A'(z)}{A(z)}\right)x^{A(z)/z}, \quad 0\leq x,z \leq 1$$ 
>
> where $A'(z)$ denotes the derivate of function $A(z)$ at point $z.$

Since $A$ is a convex function defined on $[0, 1]$ and satisfies $-1 \leq A'(z) \leq 1$, by extension, we define $A'(1)$ as the supremum of $A'(z)$ over $(0, 1)$. By setting $x = 1$ in the previous result, we obtain the marginal distribution of $Z$:
$$P(Z \leq z) = G_Z(z) = z + z(1 - z) \frac{A'(z)}{A(z)}, \quad 0 \leq z \leq 1.$$

This result was demonstrated by Deheuvels (1991) in the case where $A$ admits a second derivative.


## Simulation of Bivariate Extreme Value Distributions

To simulate a bivariate extreme value distribution $C(x, y)$, if $F_1$ and $F_2$ are univariate extreme value distributions, then the pair $( F_1^{-1}(X), F_2^{-1}(Y) )$ is distributed according to a bivariate extreme value distribution. The proposed algorithm allows simulating such a distribution.

Assume $A$ has a second derivative, making the distribution $F$ absolutely continuous. In this case, $Z$ is also absolutely continuous and has a density $g_Z(z)$ given by:
$$g_Z(z) = \frac{d}{dz} G_Z(z) = 1 + (1 - z)^{-1} \left(A(z) - z A'(z)\right)$$

The conditional distribution of $W$ given $Z$ is:
$$F(w|z) = \frac{1}{g_Z(z)} \frac{d}{dz} F(z, w)$$ 

Which simplifies to:
$$F(w|z) = w \frac{z(1 - z) A'(z)}{A(z) g_Z(z)} + (w - w \log w) \left(1 - \frac{z(1 - z) A''(z)}{A(z) g_Z(z)} \right)$$

Given $Z$, the distribution of $W$ is uniform on $(0, 1)$ with probability $p(Z)$ and equals the product of two independent uniforms on $(0, 1)$ with probability $1 - p(Z)$, where:
$$p(z) = \frac{z(1 - z) A'(z)}{A(z) g_Z(z)}$$

Since $g_Z(z)$ is the derivative of the cumulative distribution function of $Z$, it holds that $0 \leq p(z) \leq 1$.

For the class of Extreme Value Copulas, we propose two different algorithms to generate samples from a copula.

### Conditional Sampling for Bivariate Extreme Value Copulas

When this is defined, TwinCopulas uses Algorithm 1, introduced in [`reference`], to sample from the copula and its derivative as follows. We adapt Algorithm 1 from  [`reference`] for the case of bivariate Extreme Value Copulas. The input for the algorithm is a bivariate Extreme Value Copula $C: [0,1]^2 \to [0,1].$

### Sampling from Archimedean Copula Using Frailty Distribution

### Algorithm

Here, is a detailed algorithm for sampling from bivariate Extreme Value Copulas proposed by Ghoudi:
> **Algotithm 2: Bivariate Extreme Value Copulas**
> 
> *(1)* Simulate $U_1,U_2 \sim \mathcal{U}[0,1]$
>
> *(2)* Simulate $Z \sim G_Z(z)$ 
>
> *(3)* Select $W=U_1$ with probability $p(Z)$ and $W=U_1U_2$ with probability $1-p(Z)$
> 
> *(4)* Return $X=W^{Z/A(Z)}$ and $Y=W^{(1-Z)/A(Z)}$  

We can use either of the two algorithms to generate random samples, and more specifically, by default, TwinCopulas uses Algorithm 2 to obtain samples from a bivariate extreme value copula.
